# Shortcuts
I love shortcuts on iOS, and I've made embarrasingly many of them. Here are some of my shortcuts for you to try or reuse :-) 

You will need [the Shortcuts app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id915249334?mt=8 "Shortcuts app for iOS") for iOS in order to run the shortcuts on your iPhone or iPad.

1. [Automatically generated “Happy Birthday” message](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/7653857dc22b43e6b6e7de1bdc8dada9 "Automatically generated “Happy Birthday” message")

This shortcut generates a tailored “happy birthday” messages to any chosen receipient, and tweaks the message based on the repents gender and name.

2. [Research paper link converter](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ae1102c1ed4445cb928d56e04befcd7d "Research paper link converter")

This converts any link to a search paper into an easily accessible, public link that allows you to download research papers when not on the campus network. 

Navigated to the paper you want to read, tap the shortcut and the PDF link becomes available.

3. [Simple counter shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ee2b3f5942e14631a137cd873b474552
 "Simple counter shortcut")

I made this shortcut when I needed to count every instance of speech communication between two participants in a research study.

Every tab on the button simply increments the counter number and saves it in Health app – yes, the Health app! – for automatic sync.

4. [Diary saved in Notes app](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/da868175766a45e499eefe48cbcd3a72
 "Diary saved in Notes app")

I write some everyday experiences down in a diary. Every entry is saved on a new line in Notes app with date stamp.
